        <p>Changepond is committed to maintaining robust privacy 	protections for its users.  Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy 	Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use 	and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in 	making informed decisions when using our Service. </p>
        <p><strong>I. INFORMATION 	WE COLLECT</strong></p>
        <p>We 	collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” 	 Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be 	used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, 	general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages 	and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences 	that are generated based on the data you submit and number of 	clicks.  Personal Information includes only your email, which 	you submit to us through the registration process at the Site.</p>
        <p>To 	activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal 	Information other than your email address.  To use the Service 	thereafter, you do not need to submit further Personal Information. 	 However, in an effort to improve the quality of the Service, 	we track information provided to us by your browser or by our 	software application when you view or use the Service, such as the 	website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type 	of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the 	Service, the time and date of access, and other information that 	does not personally identify you.  We track this information 	using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique 	identifier.  Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our 	servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive.  Sending 	a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal 	information about that user and keep a record of the user’s 	preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and 	aggregate basis.</p>
        <p>For example, the Company may use cookies to 	collect the following information.</p>
        <p><strong>II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</strong></p>
        <p><i>Personal Information</i></p>
        <p>Except 	as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, 	rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal 	Information with third parties without your consent. We do share 	Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for 	the Company, such as the servers for our email communications who 	are provided access to user’s email address for purposes of 	sending emails from us.  Those vendors use your Personal 	Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy 	Policy.</p>
        <p>In 	general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help 	us communicate with you.  For example, we use Personal 	Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit 	feedback from users, provide technical support, and inform users 	about promotional offers.</p>
        <p><i>Non-Personal 	Information</i></p>
        <p>In 	general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the 	Service and customize the user experience.  We also aggregate 	Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use 	patterns on the Site.  This Privacy Policy does not limit in 	any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we 	reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information 	to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our 	discretion.</p>
        <p>In 	the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, 	acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our 	assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets 	transferred.  You acknowledge and consent that such transfers 	may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any 	acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal 	Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  If our 	information practices change at any time in the future, we will post 	the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new 	information practices.  We suggest that you check the Site 	periodically if you are concerned about how your information is 	used.</p>
        <p><strong>III. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION</strong></p>
        <p>We 	implement security measures designed to protect your information 	from unauthorized access.  Your account is protected by your 	account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal 	information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out 	of your account after each use.  We further protect your 	information from potential security breaches by implementing certain 	technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and 	secure socket layer technology.  However, these measures do not 	guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, 	altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server 	software.  By using our Service, you acknowledge that you 	understand and agree to assume these risks.</p>
        <p><strong>IV. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
        <p>You 	have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for 	marketing purposes.  When we send a promotional communication 	to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional 	communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in 	each promotional e-mail.  You can also indicate that you do not 	wish to receive marketing communications from us in the “Settings” 	section of the Site.  Please note that notwithstanding the 	promotional preferences you indicate by either unsubscribing or 	opting out in the Settings section of the Site, we may continue to 	send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic 	updates to our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>V. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</strong></p>
        <p>As 	part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with 	other websites or applications.  However, we are not 	responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or 	the information or content they contain.  This Privacy Policy 	applies solely to information collected by us through the Site and 	the Service.  Therefore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to 	your use of a third party website accessed by selecting a link on 	our Site or via our Service.  To the extent that you access or 	use the Service through or on another website or application, then 	the privacy policy of that other website or application will apply 	to your access or use of that site or application.  We 	encourage our users to read the privacy statements of other websites 	before proceeding to use them.</p>
        <p><strong>VI. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
        <p>The 	Company reserves the right to change this policy and our Terms of 	Service at any time.  We will notify you of significant changes 	to our Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the primary email 	address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice 	on our site.  Significant changes will go into effect 30 days 	following such notification.  Non-material changes or 	clarifications will take effect immediately. You should periodically 	check the Site and this privacy page for updates.</p>
